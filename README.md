# Validation Tests Project

This project was created for a Master's discipline of the Computer Department of UFSCar. The main objective of this project is to test and validate the effectiveness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in testing web pages. 

## Project Goals

1. **Evaluate LLM-generated code**: Assess if the code generated by various LLMs is assertive enough to test web pages.
2. **Human Interaction**: Determine if the generated code requires human interaction to work correctly.
3. **Effectiveness**: Verify if the generated code works at all when provided with:
   - A screenshot of the website
   - A description of the website
   - The HTML code of the website

## Methodology

The project involves generating test code using different LLMs based on the provided inputs (screenshot, description, HTML code) and then validating the generated code's effectiveness and accuracy.

## Conclusion

The results of this project will help in understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in generating test code for web pages and the extent of human intervention required to make the generated code functional.
